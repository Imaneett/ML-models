# ML-models code Examples
This repository includes demonstrations of machine learning using OpenCV, YOLOv3, Python, and NumPy, as well as a cascade classifier.<br />
YOLOv3 is a high-performance object detection algorithm that is both quick and precise.<br />
OpenCV is a widely-used computer vision library that offers a variety of resources for processing images and videos. <br />
NumPy is a numerical computing library that is used for conducting mathematical operations on arrays.<br />
A cascade classifier is a type of object detection algorithm that uses a machine learning technique called Haar cascades to identify objects in an image. It involves breaking down an image into smaller sub-regions, and then using a classifier to determine if each sub-region contains the object of interest. This process is repeated multiple times, with each subsequent iteration focusing on the sub-regions that were identified as potentially containing the object in the previous iteration. Cascade classifiers are commonly used in computer vision applications for tasks such as face detection, pedestrian detection, and object tracking.

## Installation
  
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:<br />
  1.OpenCV <br />
  2.NumPy <br />
  3.imutils <br />
You can install these libraries using pip, by running the following commands: <br />
```python
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
